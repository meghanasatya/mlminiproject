# 🗳️ Voting Intention Prediction

This is a beginner-level Machine Learning mini project that predicts whether a voter will support a candidate based on demographic and social features.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the basics of classification in Machine Learning by building a model to predict voting intention.

## 🧠 Model Used
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling
- Train-Test Split: 80-20
- Accuracy Achieved: ~50%

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio (for simple deployment)

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Feature encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Basic ML deployment
